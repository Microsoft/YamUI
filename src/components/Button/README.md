## Content guidelines

Use concise, specific, self-explanatory text, usually a single word. Should include a verb. If acting on something, text should include the noun it is acting on. Ex. "Create Group"

## Notes for use

While buttons can technically be used to navigate a user to another part of the experience, this is not recommended unless that navigation is part of an action or their flow.
