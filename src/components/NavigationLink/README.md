# NavigationLink

This renders an `<a>` tag for navigation between web pages.

## Properties

| Prop | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| href * | string | The URL |
| newWindow | boolean | If true, will open the URL in a new window and securely break any reference back to this window. |
| unstyled | boolean | If true, will render the content as if it were not nested in an `<a>` tag. |

## Notes for use

`NavigationLink` purposefully does not offer an `onClick` event as it should only be used for navigation. Please use a `Clickable` component for event handlers.

## Examples

### Basic usage

```js
<NavigationLink href="my_page.html">
  This NavigationLink is tabbable and navigates to the given href when clicked.
</NavigationLink>.
```
