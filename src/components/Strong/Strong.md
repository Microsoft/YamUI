### Examples

`Strong` should be used when specific text has stronger importance, like a warning or a label. If you just need to visually bold text without a semantic importance please use `Text` with bold = true.

Basic
```js { "props": { "data-description": "basic" } }
<Strong>This text is in a Strong component</Strong>, which simply renders a `strong` html element.
```
